Svelte version of my personal [Pluoro blog](https://pluoro.com/blog) website

This app allows every [Pluoro](https://pluoro.com) user to create Blog content for their applications.
 
Flow:

- New user comes to [Pluoro blog](https://pluoro.com/blog) app

- User creates Application

- After Application is created, User creates Page

- After Page is created, then they create Article for the Page they want that article to appear in.
  
  Also interesting part is that user can create subpage for their page, just by specifying the parent page.

  So users can have structure similar to this one:

  - Blog
    - Music
      - Article 1
      - Article 2
    - Food
      - Article 3
      - Article 4


Because all blogs are very similar by their constitution, in this way users only create content for their websites, and we remove whole that boilerplate that different users write over and over.
